LAMO v KEAVENEY
==

A stochastic analysis of the likelihood of them both playing the same song at the same time during a set.

Assumptions:
- Set length of 90 minutes
- Song length of 3 minutes
- Around 30% of the songs in their set will be the same
- There is no correlation between the previous song played and the next one

Over time we find the result converges nicely on 26.49%.
